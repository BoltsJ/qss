# Quick Status Select
This is a fork of the origial projekt. I've rebuilt it to provide support to the following:
- Foundry v12
- Lancer RPG
- Pathfinder 2e
- Monk's Little Details

It should work with any combination of the above. Most other systems and modules should work, as long as they don't change how the status hud is displayed. 

### A Foundry VTT module that helps quickly select effects for a token or tokens by replacing the built-in status effect selector with an auto-complete-esque search box and filtered list.
